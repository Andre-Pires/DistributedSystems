DistributedSystems
==================

Project developed for IST, Sistemas Distribuídos course

Project consists in creating a Web Service in JAVA that manages the emission of invoices from a restaurant, using UDDI and JAX-WS. 
The project relies on Fénix Framework by IST, for the storage of information on a MySQL database.

Created by: Alexandre Pimentel, Filipe Bento and myself (André Pires).

Note: The project should be linked with the SoftwareEngineering project to control the invoices emmitted by restaurants registered in the management portal.
